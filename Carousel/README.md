# Carousel

3/16/2022
- Was able to get the images to continuously scroll left or right one image at a time not dependent on the original position
- The next steps are:
  - getting the dots to respond to its corresponding image being in view
  - thumbnails of each image at the bottom that someone can hover or click over to have that image move into view
    - Will need to know the exactly position of each image in order move it from any position to whatever is selected on the thumbnail section

- Made good progress today getting the images to slide on click
  - Used add/remove class but there are some restrictoins with that
  - Experimenting with canvas and JS animations
  - Not exactly what path to take to achieve the finished project

This is a carousel display that incorporates JS and CSS animations
